                <p>The annual college fee is comparatively affordable than many other colleges. It is around 30k annually. I qualified through CET and chose this college, so I feel that the total expenses for my education are affordable. I am a day scholar and until before lockdown, I traveled through a bus facility provided by the college, which cost me around 22k annually. There are various scholarships awarded by the college to people who are in dire need of it.</p>
